## To preview HTML

Run the server by typing in the terminal:
```
python3 -m http.server
```

## Describing Anchor tags
Create an anchor element with the href attribute being "apple.com"
and the inner text is Apple.
```
<a href="apple.com">Apple</a>
```

## Self closing tags
When the inner text is not needed, we can use self-closing.
So instead of `<img></img>`, we can just do `<img/>`

## Elements can have more than one attributes
```
 <img src="thaifood.jpg" alt="Decicious plate of Thai basil chicken rice"/>
 ```

 This is an element with > 1 attribute. ** The order of the attributes does not matter**
